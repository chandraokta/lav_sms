# Summary of Changes to Align Application with app_summary.md

## Issues Identified
1. The Librarian role was missing from the UserTypesTableSeeder, even though it was referenced in the documentation and menu.
2. The `userIsLibrarian()` method was missing from the Qs helper class.
3. There was no Librarian middleware to control access for librarian users.
4. The librarian role was not properly integrated into the user system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Librarian Role to UserTypesTableSeeder
- Added the librarian role to the database seeder with title 'librarian', name 'Librarian', and level 6
- This ensures that when the database is seeded, the librarian role is available

### 2. Added userIsLibrarian() Method to Qs Helper Class
- Added the missing `userIsLibrarian()` method to the Qs helper class
- This allows the application to check if a user is a librarian

### 3. Created Librarian Middleware
- Created a new middleware class for librarians following the same pattern as other role middlewares
- This middleware checks if the authenticated user is a librarian and redirects to login if not

### 4. Registered Librarian Middleware in Kernel.php
- Added the librarian middleware to the route middleware array in Kernel.php
- This makes the middleware available for use in routes

### 5. Added Library Routes for Librarians
- Added resource routes for books and book_requests in the web.php routes file
- Created a specific route group for librarians with the 'librarian' middleware

### 6. Added Librarian User to UsersTableSeeder
- Added a default librarian user to the createNewUsers() method
- Updated the createManyUsers() method to include librarians in the generated users

## Role Implementation Verification
All 7 user roles mentioned in app_summary.md are now properly implemented:
- Super Admin
- Admin
- Librarian
- Accountant
- Teacher
- Student
- Parent

## Librarian Functionality
The librarian functionality now includes:
- Manage Books in the Library
- Handle book requests
- Manage library inventory

These features are accessible through the library management section in the navigation menu when logged in as a librarian.

## Next Steps
To fully test these changes, you would need to:
1. Run the database migrations: `php artisan migrate:fresh`
2. Seed the database: `php artisan db:seed`
3. Test logging in as the librarian user with credentials:
   - Username: librarian
   - Email: librarian@librarian.com
   - Password: cj
4. Verify that the librarian can access the library management features
